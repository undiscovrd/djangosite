Setting up GoodLoaf
---------------------
1. Ensure that Python (2.7 used here) is installed
2. Set up a database.
    Credentials: databasename: djangobase@localhost
                       user: goodloaf
                       pass: dosh1
    Use MySQL.
        How To install MySQL
            - Download and install MySQL (just getting the full suite of tools is easiest. For light install, you just need the server and the MySQL workbench)
            - Create a connection with connection name "djangobase", then use the user and password specified above
            - Create a schema called djangobase (database essentially but called schema here)
3. Install Django (version 1.6 used here)
    Note: Do not use pip to install, just run python setup.py install from inside the unzipped folder
4. cd into the Goodloaf/mysite/ directory
5. run `python ./manage.py syncdb` to initialize the database you created with the right tables
6. to run server, type 'python ./manage.py runserver'
7. get to the landing page by going to url: `localhost:8000`
